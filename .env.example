# GitHub OAuth Configuration
# Get these values from https://github.com/settings/developers
# Create a new OAuth App and copy the Client ID

EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id_here

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
# The Client Secret should NEVER be exposed in frontend code in production!
# This is only for development/testing purposes.
# In production, you MUST handle token exchange on your backend server.
# For now, you can add it here for testing:
EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret_here

# Note: Make sure .env is in your .gitignore file
